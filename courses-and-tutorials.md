# Courses and Tutorials

We want to remind you that, as stated in our server guidelines, watching videos i more often than not no comprehensive way to learn something and will never replace documentation. To keep a video short and to the point, a lot is often skipped. It is however a great way to get a general idea of how something works by seeing it in action. That's why we included a lot of video courses and tutorials in this list.
